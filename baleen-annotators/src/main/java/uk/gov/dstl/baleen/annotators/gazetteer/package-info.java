/**
 * Contains annotators that annotate entities based on a Gazetteer
 * 
 * <p>A gazetteer is essentially a list of terms we are interested in, and gazetteer annotators will
 * look for each of these terms in turn and annotate them within the document. Annotators in this package
 * largely all perform the same function, with the primary difference being the source of the gazetteer.</p>
 * <p>A gazetteer approach gives high precision and recall on the terms it matches, but does require someone
 * to put together a comprehensive gazetteer in the first place as anything not in the gazetteer will not be
 * extracted. This also makes it sensitive to spelling mistakes, variations on spelling, etc.</p>
