/**
 * Contains annotators that are based on regular expressions (Regex).
 * 
 * Regular expressions are a technique for matching patterns within text, for example e-mail addresses or MGRS coordinates.
 * The annotators in this package generally have the regular expressions built in, but you can also specify your own using
 * the {@link Custom} annotator.
 * <p>
 * Regular expressions are good at extracting things that follow a well defined pattern,
 * but can struggle in cases where the entity does not follow that pattern.
 * It is also possible for regular expressions to pull out things that aren't correct, because they match the pattern.
 * For example, phone numbers are just a string of numbers and so a regular expression annotator might incorrectly decide
 * that any string of numbers (of the right length) is a phone number.
 * <p>
 * Annotators in this package inherit from abstract annotators in the {@link uk.gov.dstl.baleen.annotators.regex.helpers} package,
 * and in some cases may pass off to classes in the {@link uk.gov.dstl.baleen.annotators.regex.internals} package to avoid naming conflicts.
