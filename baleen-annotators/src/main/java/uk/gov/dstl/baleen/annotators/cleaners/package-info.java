/**
 * Contains annotators that clean up after other annotators, for example removing nested annotations.
 * 
 * <p>Generally, annotators act independently of other annotators. This can lead to nested annotations
 * or the same annotation being pulled out several times.
 * In addition to this, what is extracted by annotators isn't always clean or standardised.
 * To address both these issues, we use cleaners at the end of the pipeline to examine existing annotations and
 * tidy them up.</p>
 * <p>Classes in this package will generally go at the end of the pipeline, once all the other annotators
 * have done the extraction.</p>
