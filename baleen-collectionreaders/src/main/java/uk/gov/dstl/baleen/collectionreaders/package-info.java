 * <p>Collection Readers are used to read in a data set and pass 'documents' from it into the Baleen pipeline.
 * In Baleen, we have modified the UIMA concept of a Collection Reader so that it is permanently looking for new content;
 * that is, the doHasNext() method on BaleenCollectionReader will be continuously polled for new documents.</p>
